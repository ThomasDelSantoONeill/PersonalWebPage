# PersonalWebPage

Here I present my own personal website built with the [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) R package. The following are some good resources to help you get started:

+ [Daniel Quintana's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox_Ue9yzf-0) has a simple and straightforward video.
+ You can also find documentation on the academic theme by George Cushen [here](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/).
