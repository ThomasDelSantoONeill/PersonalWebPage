I am a 1<sup>st</sup> year PhD student in Biological Sciences on the [London Interdisciplinary Doctoral Programme](http://lido-dtp.ac.uk/) (LIDo) funded by the [Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council](https://bbsrc.ukri.org/) (BBSRC) at [Queen Mary, University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/) (QMUL). 

I am working on the optimisation of **Maximum Sustainable Yield** (MSY) from **mixed-fisheries** where **multiple stocks** (*i.e.* species) interact through **predation** and **competition**. My workflow comprises the usage of **food web models** that render natural marine ecosystems (*e.g.* **North Sea**) to evaluate the attainability of MSY defined in the context of **Game Theory**. A breif description of the project is provided [here](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbcs/postgraduate/phd-programmes/projects/display-title-640415-en.html).
